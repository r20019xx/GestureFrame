{#        CS5704 Team Project. Our team wanted to create a program that assiste ASL users by enabling them to fully express themselves in ASL.#}
{#    </p>#}
{#    <p>#}
{#        Currently we have trained a YOLO5 model which reads in ASL in video and predicts what word is being signed. The next step is to convert the predicted signed word into text as output.#}

    <div class="about-content">
        <p>
          SignVisionAI started as our CS5704 Team Project aimed to empower Deaf and hard‑of‑hearing communities by leveraging computer vision.
            Our goal is to let people sign freely in ASL and have our system translate it instantly into text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under the hood we’ve trained a <strong>YOLOv5</strong> model on hundreds of labeled ASL signs. It runs real‑time in the browser via Django → REST → JavaScript, detecting hand gestures and returning the corresponding word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next up (outside course expectations):  
          <ul>
            <li>Fine‑tune for continuous signing (multiple words in sequence)</li>
            <li>Expand the vocabulary to include fingerspelling for names & uncommon words</li>
            <li>Build a mobile‑friendly UI so you can sign on the go</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p> Our team is passionate about making communication more accessible. </p>
